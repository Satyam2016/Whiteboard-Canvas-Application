Designed and built a real-time AI-powered collaborative whiteboard using React, Firebase, Rough.js, and WebRTC for a seamless multi-user experience. The whiteboard features:

✅ Real-time Drawing & Collaboration – Multiple users can draw and edit in sync using Firebase Firestore’s real-time updates.
✅ Advanced Drawing Tools – Supports freehand, shapes (rectangles, circles, lines), stroke styles, and colors powered by Rough.js.
✅ Authentication & Session Management – Secure login via Google OAuth (Firebase Auth) and private/shared sessions.
✅ Undo/Redo & Version Control – Implemented action history tracking for improved usability.
✅ AI-Powered Features (Upcoming) – Leveraging AI for handwriting recognition and shape auto-correction.
✅ Multi-Device Compatibility – Optimized for desktop & tablet use with touch and stylus support.

Future enhancements include WebRTC-based voice/video chat, AI-assisted sketch enhancement, and exporting whiteboard sessions as PDFs.
